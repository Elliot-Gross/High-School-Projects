**Title:** The Wonders of Physics

**Summary:** Physics is unique among the sciences in that it seeks to understand how things happen. It looks at the reason things happen and explains it. The ultimate goal of physics is to understand the universe around us, from tiny intermolecular particles to entire solar systems. Physics is applied mathematics, taking the tools learned in math classes and applying them to real-world problems. The purpose of physics is to better understand the world around us. 

**Main Points:**
- Physics is unique among the sciences in that it seeks to understand how things happen.
- The ultimate goal of physics is to understand the universe around us.
- Physics is applied mathematics, taking the tools learned in math classes and applying them to real-world problems.
- The purpose of physics is to better understand the world around us.
- Physics has a bad reputation as being one of the hardest sciences you can take in high school.
- Every concept should be broken down and simplified.
- From the fundamental Newtonian equations to the famous Eagles MC squared, together we will embark on a journey to better understand the world around us.

**Action Items:**
- Learn and understand the fundamental Newtonian equations.
- Apply math concepts learned in previous classes to real-world physics problems.
- Break down and simplify physics concepts to better understand them.
- Explore the universe around us to better understand the principles of physics.
- Practice using math tools to solve physics problems.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- What are some real-world problems that physics can help solve?
- How can we better understand the universe around us through physics?
- What are some common misconceptions about physics?
- How can we make physics more accessible to students?
- What are some practical applications of physics in everyday life?

**Stories:**
- The discovery of the Higgs boson particle and how it helped us better understand the fundamental building blocks of the universe.
- The development of the theory of relativity and how it changed our understanding of space and time.
- The invention of the telescope and how it allowed us to observe and study the universe in greater detail.
- The use of physics in engineering and design, such as in the construction of bridges and buildings.
